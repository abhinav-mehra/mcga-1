4399:M 18 Apr 01:14:52.289 # WARNING overcommit_memory is set to 0! Background
save may fail under low memory condition. To fix this issue add
'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the
command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
4399:M 18 Apr 01:14:52.289 # WARNING you have Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
support enabled in your kernel. This will create latency and memory usage
issues with Redis. To fix this issue run the command 'echo never >
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' as root, and add it to your
/etc/rc.local in order to retain the setting after a reboot. Redis must be
restarted after THP is disabled.
